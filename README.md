# SpeechScrubber
Speech Scrubber is a handy web application to transcribe audio files and to see a transcript displayed that lets you click on the transcript to jump to the respective time in the audio clip. We utilize the Rev.AI speech to text API to transcribe audio files then provide extra functionality to jump to the relevant part of the audio file that you want.
